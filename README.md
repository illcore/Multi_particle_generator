* Multi-particle generator based on atmospherical protons as well as atmospherical alphas from the BESS-TeV spectrometer;
* One is supposed to use the executable+run1.mac without any change to employ the GEANT4 package appropriately;
* If/when necessary, one is supposed to remove/close the visualization macro (vis.mac) in run1.mac to prevent any possible computer crash.
